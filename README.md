Treasure Island Ama Adventure

Description
Treasure Island Adventure is an engaging, top-down game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is to navigate an island map, collect as many treasure chests as possible, and level up before time runs out. The game features two modes: a single-player challenge to beat your personal high score and a competitive two-player mode. Each level increases the number and speed of obstacles, making it progressively more challenging. Players receive bonus time and extra lives at specific milestones, and collecting 15 points or more grants a bonus 5 seconds for every 5 points earned thereafter. The game includes customisable avatars and a dynamic scoreboard to track your progress and compete with others.


How to Play
1. Getting Started

Select your mode: Choose between a 1-player or a 2-player game using the radio buttons.

Enter your name(s): Type in your name(s) in the text boxes.

Pick your avatar: Click on an avatar to select your character for the game.

Start the game: Press the Play button to begin.

2. Controls

Player 1: Use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move your character.

Player 2 (2-player mode): Use the WASD keys (W=Up, A=Left, S=Down, D=Right) to move your character.

3. Gameplay

Treasure: Your goal is to run into the 💰 treasure icon to collect it. Each treasure collected adds one point to your score.

Obstacles: Avoid the moving obstacles like crocodiles (🐊), fire (🔥), and coconuts (🥥). Colliding with an obstacle will decrease your lives.

Score and Lives: Your score, remaining lives, time left, and current level are all displayed on the scoreboard in the top-left corner.

End of Game: The game ends when your lives run out or the timer hits zero. The final scores are displayed, and if you've earned a new high score, it will be saved.

4. Special Bonuses

Level Up: Every 5 points you collect, you level up. This adds 10 seconds to the timer.

Time Bonus: Once you reach 15 points, you'll earn an extra 5 seconds on the timer every time your score is a multiple of 5 (e.g., at 20, 25, 30, and so on).

Bonus Life: You will receive an extra life when you reach Level 6.

Mute: You can mute the game's music and sound effects at any time by clicking the Mute 🔇 button.
